# AI-ENHANCED-CAREER-EXPLORATION-AND-GUIDANCE
Choosing the right career path is a significant challenge for students, often influenced by limited access to personalized guidance and a lack of data-driven insights. Traditional career counseling methods provide generalized recommendations that fail to consider an individualâ€™s strengths, interests, and aptitudes, leading to uncertainty and poor decision-making. 
Many students, particularly in underserved areas, lack access to career advisors, making it difficult to receive tailored guidance. As a result, they may select careers that do not align with their skills, causing dissatisfaction and reduced professional growth. Without an effective system to analyze student abilities and suggest suitable career options, mismatches between chosen fields and skillsets become common. 
To address this issue, an AI-powered career guidance system is necessary. By leveraging machine learning and deep learning, such a system can provide personalized career recommendations based on students' test scores and interests, ensuring well-informed career decisions and better future opportunities. 

## Project scope
The scope of this project is to develop an AI-powered career guidance system that provides personalized career recommendations for students based on their strengths, interests, and aptitudes. The system evaluates students through structured assessments and utilizes machine learning models, including a Feedforward Neural Network (FNN), to classify them into suitable career categories. Additionally, a recommendation system maps these career categories to relevant job roles based on industry demand.
The project is designed to be accessible to high school and college students, including those from underserved regions, ensuring inclusivity in career guidance. It aims to bridge the gap between education and career planning by offering data-driven insights. 
Future enhancements may include expanding datasets, integrating real-time job market trends, and refining recommendation accuracy to provide even more tailored career suggestions. This system empowers students to make confident, informed career decisions. 

## Methodology
### 1) The project collects career-related data, including various intelligence and skill categories, and preprocesses it by handling missing values, normalizing data, and performing feature engineering.
### 2) Students undergo structured assessments, where they answer predefined questions, and their responses are scored to create a feature vector representing their strengths and interests.
### 3) A Feedforward Neural Network (FNN) model is trained on historical data to classify students into career categories based on their assessment scores, improving accuracy through optimization techniques.
### 4) A recommendation system maps predicted career categories to specific job roles, utilizing text vectorization and cosine similarity to provide tailored career suggestions.
### 5) The system ensures accessibility and scalability, allowing for future enhancements such as additional datasets, real-time industry trends, and refined recommendation algorithms for more accurate career guidance.
